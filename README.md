Video Games Sales Analysis

Problem Statement:

The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on video game sales data to identify trends and patterns in sales performance. The data includes information on global sales, platforms, genres, publishers, and regions over several years. The goal is to uncover key insights such as which genres or platforms are the most popular, how sales have evolved over time, and which regions dominate the video game market. These insights can guide strategic decisions for publishers, game developers, and marketers.

What I Did:

1. Data Cleaning:

I handled missing values by applying imputation for missing sales data where appropriate.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:

Explored global sales trends over the years.

Analyzed the top-selling genres and platforms.

Examined region-based sales, highlighting which regions contribute the most to global sales.

3. Data Transformation:

Used grouping techniques to analyze sales by genre, platform, and region.

Created new features to reflect monthly or yearly sales growth.

4. Visualization:

Created multiple visualizations such as line charts to track sales trends, bar charts for genre and platform comparison, and pie charts to show market share by region.


Tools Used:

Python, libraries like - Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook: The environment used to execute and document the analysis.

Recommendation:

1. Focus on Genre-Specific Marketing:

Based on the analysis, Action and Sports genres dominate in global sales. Game developers should consider investing more in these genres, potentially creating spin-offs or sequels to capitalize on their popularity.

2. Platform-Specific Strategies:

The Wii and PS2 are leading platforms in terms of sales. Game publishers should continue to support these platforms or develop cross-platform games that cater to the most popular platforms.

3. Region-Based Strategy:

North America and Europe show the highest total sales. Marketers should focus their promotional efforts more in these regions while exploring untapped potential in Other Regions, such as Asia and South America, which contribute less but still offer room for growth.

4. Seasonal Sales Patterns:

The sharp peak in sales in the mid-2000s indicates potential seasonality. Future marketing campaigns could target holiday seasons or specific periods when gaming interest surges.

Conclusion:

This analysis provided valuable insights into the global video game sales landscape. It revealed the dominance of Action and Sports genres, with platforms like Wii and PS2 leading the market. The regional breakdown highlighted that North America and Europe are the biggest contributors to sales, while Japan and Other Regions show comparatively lower sales but still have significant potential for growth.

In conclusion, the key takeaway is that the gaming market is highly dynamic, with genre popularity, platform dominance, and regional trends all influencing sales patterns. This analysis helps identify where game developers and publishers should focus their efforts, both in terms of game development and marketing strategies. Future analysis could explore predictive modeling to forecast future trends in the industry.
